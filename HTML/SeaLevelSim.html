<h1>A Rise in Sea Levels</h1>

<h4>Our environment is our home.</h4>
<p>It is our duty to take care of it like we would a member of our own family, but we have proved lacking. Because of humanity's high consumption of fossil fuels creating large amounts of greenhouse gases, sea levels are rising as the Earth is warming. The ocean's natural currents are being disrupted, which can have deadly consequences for the animals that live in it, and the sea's rise threatens islands and coastal communities all across the globe.</p>
<p>Here in Virginia, we live in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. As the oceans rise, the Chesapeake and the rivers that flow from it will rise as well. We will be affected by these changes. The best we can do is try to mitigate them as much as possible.</p>
<p>This simulation aims to show the consequences of sea level rise around the Chesapeake Bay according to several different models depending on fossil fuel use. We hope you will use this information to be a better and more environmentally conscious member of our community.</p>
