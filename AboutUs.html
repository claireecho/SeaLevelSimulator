<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>After the loss of one of the triumvirate, the two founders were at a loss regarding what to do at HackTJ 10.0. They had planned for a team-up among friends, but were left with only each other. Thankfully, two newcomers had entered the scene and were willing to help make this idea a reality. Without their help, CSSQ would not be where it is today. </p>
